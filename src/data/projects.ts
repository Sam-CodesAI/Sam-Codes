      "Instant 24/7 conversational Telegram bot qualifying client project briefs, extracting structured requirements, and inserting verified leads into Supabase PostgreSQL.",
    fullDescription:
      "A production-grade agentic workflow solving inquiry response delays. The system ingests incoming messages via an authenticated Telegram Bot API webhook, maintains multi-turn conversation state, grounds responses in Samarth's live service catalog, extracts structured lead entities (service requested, timeline, contact info), and logs them directly into Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time audit trails.",

      "Engineered an autonomous multi-turn state machine running on Next.js 16 serverless edge endpoints.
